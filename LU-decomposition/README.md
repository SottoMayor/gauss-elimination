# LU-decomposition

## General Idea
Any square matrix M can be written as the product of two matrices, M = LU, where L is a lower triangular matrix and U is an upper triangular matrix.

- Upper triangular matrix: \( a_ij = 0 \) when \( j > i \).

- Lower triangular matrix: \( a_ij = 0 \) when \( j < i \).

## Why use it might be a good idea?
LU decomposition simplifies solving linear systems, matrix inversion, and determinant calculation more efficiently.
